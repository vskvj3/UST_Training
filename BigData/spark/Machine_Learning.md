## Types of analysis
- **descriptive analytics**:
  - what has happened
  - what happende in past
  - historical insights about data
  - performs on historical data
  - EDA or statistical methods(max, min, sum, add, stdev, variance)
  - K-Means clustering: grouping data on basis of similarity.
- **predictive analytics (ML Models)**:
  - Statistical model
  - forecasting technique(time series)
    - future prediction
- **prescriptive analytics**:
  - what should be done?
  - advices from insights
  - optimizations
  - simulation algorithms
  - role of datascientists
## Machine Learning
- Mimics data inorder to gain knowledge and create a data driven model.
- Will be able to make predictions with high accuracy.

#### Artificial Intelligence:
- mimics human intelligence, 
- have general decision making ability
#### Machine learning:
- uses statistical methods
#### Deep Learing
- subset of ML
- functionality of neurons to artificial neural networks.

### Why Machine Learning
- facebook:personalized information
- uber: nearby rides
### Phases in ML:
- collecting data
- data wrangling
  - cleaning
  - preprocessing
- analyze data
  - statistical analysis
  - EDA
- train algorithm
- test
- deploy

### Types:
- supervised: data with labels (there is a target)
  - discover a mapping function that translates the input variable (x) to output variable (y).
    - y continuous: regression
    - y categorical: classification
  - predictive output
- unsupervised: data without labels
  - discover patterns & info that was undetected
  - find unknown patterns
  - text related data
  - customer segmentation
  - 
- semi supervised
- Reinforcement learning:
  - learn from experience

### **Spark ML**
- scalable machine learning library for spark.
- keras, tensorflow: deep learning
- sklearn: machine learning
- spark ML tools:
  - ML algos
  - features
  - Utilities
  - Pipeline
  - Persistance


- classification
- regression
- clustering
- basic statitics
- optimizations
- feature extraction
- recommendation
- reduction
