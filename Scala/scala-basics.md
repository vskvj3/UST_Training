## Functional Programming

- functinal programming is a pradigm where computation is treated as evaluation of methematical function
- It avoids chaning its state or mutable data.
- First Class Functions: 
    - Function are treated as first class 
    - Function can be passed as an argument to another function
    and can be assigned to variables

- Pure functional:
    - functions must be pure
    - same input will produce the same output
    - no side effects
### Scala
- Scalable language
- Object oriented + Functional
- Highly scalable language

- Immutability:
    - val: Immutable
    - var: Mutable

- Advantages Functional Programming Language:
    - Lazy evaluation
        - make use of resources efficient
    - bug free
    - efficient parallel processing
    - efficiency
    - nested processing

### Features of Scala
- Processess Concurrently
- Runs of JVM
- Statically Typed
- Object Oriented
- Functional
- Extensible

### Dataypes
- **Arrays**:
    - mutable
    - fixed length
    - homogenous
    - access elements using 0 based indices
- **List**
    - Immutable
    - Homogenous
    - Varibale length
    - Similat to linked list
