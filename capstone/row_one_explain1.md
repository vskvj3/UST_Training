### Step-by-step Explanation:

1. **Incident Number (`INC0000045`)**:
   - This is the unique identifier for the incident. Each incident is given a number when it is reported or logged into the system, which helps track the incident throughout its lifecycle.

2. **Incident State (`New`)**:
   - This field indicates the current status of the incident. In this case, the state is `New`, meaning the incident has just been logged and is awaiting further action (such as assignment to a support team).

3. **Active (`true`)**:
   - This Boolean value shows whether the incident is still active or not. In this case, the value is `true`, which means the incident is currently being worked on or is awaiting further action (it hasnâ€™t been resolved or closed).

4. **Reassignment Count (`0`)**:
   - This field represents the number of times the incident has been reassigned to different support groups. For this incident, it has not been reassigned (`0`), meaning the first support group assigned to the incident is still handling it.

5. **Reopen Count (`0`)**:
   - This indicates the number of times the incident has been reopened after initially being resolved. Here, the count is `0`, meaning it has not been reopened.

6. **System Modification Count (`0`)**:
   - The `sys_mod_count` field tracks how many times the incident record has been updated (modifications, comments, etc.). In this case, it is `0`, meaning no updates have been made since the incident was first created.

7. **Made SLA (`true`)**:
   - This Boolean field tells us whether the incident has met its Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. In this case, `true` means the incident is currently within its SLA, meaning it is on track to be resolved within the expected timeframe.

8. **Caller ID (`Caller 2403`)**:
   - This refers to the user who is experiencing the issue and has reported the incident. The identifier `Caller 2403` helps track which user is affected by this incident.

9. **Opened By (`Opened by 8`)**:
   - This shows who initially opened or logged the incident in the system. Here, `Opened by 8` means the user with ID `8` opened the incident.

10. **Opened At (`29/2/2016 01:16`)**:
    - This field shows the exact date and time when the incident was reported or opened. In this case, it was opened on February 29, 2016, at 01:16 AM.

11. **System Created By (`Created by 6`)**:
    - This shows who or what system created the incident record. Here, `Created by 6` means the system or user with ID `6` created this record.

12. **System Created At (`29/2/2016 01:23`)**:
    - The timestamp when the incident was officially created in the system. The record was created 7 minutes after the incident was opened.

13. **System Updated By (`Updated by 21`)**:
    - This shows the user or system that last updated the incident. Here, the incident was last updated by the user or system with ID `21`.

14. **System Updated At (`29/2/2016 01:23`)**:
    - This is the timestamp when the last update to the incident occurred, which is the same as the `sys_created_at` value, meaning no additional updates have been made after creation.

15. **Contact Type (`Phone`)**:
    - The method through which the incident was reported. In this case, the caller reported the incident via a phone call.

16. **Location (`Location 143`)**:
    - The location where the incident is happening or where the affected service is located. Here, `Location 143` refers to a specific office or geographical location within the organization.

17. **Category (`Category 55`)**:
    - This field classifies the type of service affected. `Category 55` represents a particular service area, such as "Network" or "Software," but would need a lookup table to understand exactly what `55` means.

18. **Subcategory (`Subcategory 170`)**:
    - This is a more specific description of the service under the main category. For instance, if the category is "Network," the subcategory might be "Wi-Fi Issues." Again, a lookup table would be needed to determine what `170` specifically refers to.

19. **Symptom (`Symptom 72`)**:
    - The symptom provides a short description of the issue as reported by the caller, which might give a clue about the problem. `Symptom 72` is a coded reference to the issue, requiring a lookup table to decipher.

20. **Configuration Item (`?`)**:
    - The `cmdb_ci` refers to the specific IT asset (e.g., server, application) affected by the incident. In this case, it is not available or unknown (represented by `?`).

21. **Impact (`2 - Medium`)**:
    - The impact level describes how critical the incident is for the business or service. Here, the impact is medium, which means it affects a limited number of users or services.

22. **Urgency (`2 - Medium`)**:
    - Urgency indicates how quickly the issue needs to be resolved from the perspective of the user. A medium urgency suggests that it is important but not an immediate crisis.

23. **Priority (`3 - Moderate`)**:
    - Priority is a system-calculated field, derived from both impact and urgency. In this case, the priority is moderate (`3`), meaning it's not an emergency but should be resolved within a reasonable timeframe.

24. **Assignment Group (`Group 56`)**:
    - The assignment group refers to the team or department responsible for resolving the incident. `Group 56` is the team currently assigned to the issue, such as "Network Support" or "Helpdesk."

25. **Assigned To (`?`)**:
    - This field would typically indicate the specific person assigned to handle the incident. In this case, the value is missing (`?`), meaning no individual has been assigned yet.

26. **Knowledge (`true`)**:
    - This Boolean field indicates whether the support team used a knowledge base document to resolve the incident. In this case, `true` means a knowledge document was referenced during the incident resolution process.

27. **Priority Confirmation (`false`)**:
    - This Boolean field shows whether the priority of the incident has been manually double-checked. Here, `false` means the priority has not been manually reviewed.

28. **Notify (`Do Not Notify`)**:
    - This indicates the notification setting for the incident. `Do Not Notify` means no automatic notifications or updates will be sent out about the progress of the incident.

29. **Problem ID (`?`)**:
    - This field would link the incident to a larger problem or known issue if one exists. In this case, it is unknown (`?`).

30. **RFC (Request for Change) (`?`)**:
    - This links the incident to a change request, if the incident was caused by or resulted in a system change. Here, there is no associated change request (`?`).

31. **Vendor (`?`)**:
    - If a third-party vendor is involved in resolving the issue, their ID would be listed here. In this case, no vendor is assigned (`?`).

32. **Caused By (`?`)**:
    - This would indicate whether another process (such as a system change) caused the incident. Here, it is not specified (`?`).

33. **Close Code (`code 5`)**:
    - This is a code indicating how the incident was closed or resolved. `Code 5` could represent a specific closure reason, such as "Issue Resolved," "Workaround Applied," or "Duplicate Incident."

34. **Resolved By (`Resolved by 149`)**:
    - The user or agent who resolved the incident is identified here. In this case, `Resolved by 149` indicates the ID of the person responsible for the resolution.

35. **Resolved At (`29/2/2016 11:29`)**:
    - The timestamp when the incident was resolved. In this case, the issue was resolved on February 29, 2016, at 11:29 AM.

36. **Closed At (`5/3/2016 12:00`)**:
    - The timestamp when the incident was officially closed. It was closed on March 5, 2016, at 12:00 PM, which is a few days after it was resolved. The gap between resolution and closure suggests the incident was awaiting final confirmation or documentation before closure.
